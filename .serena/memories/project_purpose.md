# Project Purpose

This is a Go project based on the book "Goならわかるシステムプログラミング" (System Programming with Go). The project contains educational code examples demonstrating system programming concepts in Go.

## Key Features
- **Chapter 02**: Web server and various I/O writer implementations (files, console, buffers, HTTP handlers, etc.)
- **Chapter 03**: Reader implementations and file I/O operations, including PNG chunk manipulation

The code is structured as practical examples for learning Go's system programming capabilities, particularly focusing on io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces.
